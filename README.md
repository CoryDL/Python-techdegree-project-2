# Basketball Team Stats Tool
In this project I wrote a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. 
This data was translated into a new collection and the fields were changed to something that makes more sense for Python to do its comparisons.

This is a console-based application that reads from a list of players and distributes the players evenly among a number of teams which are also read from a separate file.
The application provides a menu that allows the user to pick a team, and then displays the team roster, and various stats associated with those players based on a file containing data organized in dictionaries.
The app then gives the user the opportunity to check that stats on other teams before quitting the program.
